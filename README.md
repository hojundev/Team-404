## How It Works

1. **Home screen** — tap a category (Food, Doctor, etc.) or use **Ask AI** to describe any need in your own words
2. **Venue picker** — choose what kind of place you're looking for (grocery, restaurant, pharmacy…)
3. **AI custom flow** *(Ask AI only)* — Gemini generates 2–4 culturally-aware options; tap one to continue
4. **Recommend screen** — the nearest matching place is shown with distance, duration, and a photo; switch between walking and transit
5. **Step-by-step guidance** — turn-by-turn walking route, then in-store instructions; each step has:
   - Emoji icons matched to the instruction
   - Bengali/Rohingya text as the primary heading
   - English subtitle for helpers or support workers
   - Audio playback — tap to hear the instruction read aloud (translated + AI-generated speech)

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend | Node.js, Express |

## Local Setup


### 1. Clone & Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hojundev/Sahayyo.git
cd Sahayyo
npm run install:all
```

---

### 2. Add API keys

Create `backend/.env`:

```
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
PORT=3001
```

> **No keys?** The app falls back to **demo mode** — fake directions are returned so you can test the full UI without any API calls.

---

### 3. Run both servers

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser (or on your phone via your local network IP).

- Modularize the JSON schema to support new low-resource languages (Pashto, Dari, Tigrinya)
- Offline mode — cache routes and audio for areas with poor connectivity
- Add additional task categories including Bus and School task flows
